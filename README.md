# lantern-box

The Lantern is a portable server for decentralized web applications. This repository contains all software and setup scripts required to build and adapt your own Lantern device. 3D printer files are also included for a physical device enclosure.

### Run a Local Server

Our Docker container is modeled after a Raspberry Pi Zero W. This enables us to cache our software dependencies and test as much logic as possible without loading to a physical device. Before loading to a physical device, please try running in Docker in your local environment:

```bash
make && make run
```

The resulting server will be available at: http://localhost:8080

### Setup Your Raspberry Pi Zero W

This command uses [pi-maker](https://github.com/lantern-works/pi-maker) to create the image:

```bash
make image
```


[Download Etcher](http://etcher.io) and use this to flash your image onto a MicroSD card 8GB or greater. Your image will be named "flash-to-pi.img" by default and will be located in a "build" folder.


After starting up your Lantern, you should see a wireless SSID broadcast automatically within a few minutes. You can connect to this without a password and a window should pop-up in your browser, welcoming you to the network. If on a computer, you can also SSH as the "admin" user with the password "wins" using the hostname lantern.link (this hostname works with or without internet, but you can only SSH while connected to your own Lantern device). Next, you can view status of the services by watching these logs:

```bash
journalctl -f -u lora
```

```bash
journalctl -f -u http
```

```bash
tail -f /opt/lantern/db/db-log.txt
```


### Requirements

A local [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) environment is required to begin.

Ubuntu users should install these packages before building an image:
```bash
apt-get install binfmt-support qemu-user-static make
```
